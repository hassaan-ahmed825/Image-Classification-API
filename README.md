# ðŸŒ¼ Flower Image Classification API

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end image classification system** for recognizing flowers using **Transfer Learning** with **TensorFlow/Keras** and serving predictions through a **Flask API** with **Swagger UI**.

---

## ðŸš€ **Project Highlights**

- âœ… Trained a **MobileNetV2** model on the **Flowers Dataset** (5 flower classes: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip).
- âœ… Achieved good accuracy through transfer learning.
- âœ… Built a REST API using **Flask** to serve predictions.
- âœ… Integrated **Swagger UI** (Flasgger) to test the API easily.
- âœ… Supports **multiple image uploads** in a single request.
